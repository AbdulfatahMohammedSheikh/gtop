# About
This project is build upone the same idea suggested by udacity nanaprogam on cpp. However this project uses `go` and `htmx` to do the same thing.

# Usage
 - `make start`. This will start the server for the program
 - open `http://localhost:8080/` to get list of all runnig processes.

# Todos

this app lacks same features like searching for a process and more css styling. However this project can be used to understand how same other tools like `htop` works.
